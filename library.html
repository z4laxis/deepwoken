      <p class="book-content">
      The aftermath of a battle is always ugly. <br>
      Many soldiers despise it for the injuries, the breaking of gear, or the politics that come after the victor is decided. <br>
      For me, it is the process of body watching that I dread the most.<br><br>
      It starts with collection. The bodies are everywhere, scattered around the battlefield like a stack of paper left in the wind. <br>
      Alas, it is my job, and I do as I am told. <br>
      I walk stretches of bloodied sand and dirt with my cart for hours in the unforgiving sun, packing our fallen onto its wooden surface as I go. <br>
      The dealings are always deathly quiet, disturbed only by the squeaking of my cart's old wheels.

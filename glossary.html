                            <li>Following the discovery and widespread use of the Song during the Canticlysm, a tipping point was reached, and numerous strange phenomena began to emerge.</li>
                            <li>Chief among these was the rise of the waters of Lumen, slowly at first, until all but the tallest mountain peaks were submerged.</li>
                            <li>However, the waters did not simply rise; rather, Lumen itself was dragged downward, deeper into the sea and closer to the Depths below.</li>
                            <li>With the Depths nearer than ever, sightings of misshapen monstrosities and nightmarish beasts began to plague the shores of Lumen.</li>
                            <li>These creatures forced mankind steadily inward, retreating toward the relative safety of the remaining peaks.</li>
                            <li>As the Tides came, the Void crept into the abandoned shallows and sunken ruins.</li>
                            <li>In modern times, the vast majority of Lumen is ensnared within the grasp of the Voidsea.</li>
                            <li>Beyond physical devastation, the Tides also brought an existential calamity known as the Drowning.</li>
                            <li>The era following the onset of the Tides is commonly referred to as the Aftertide, or as the Post-Tidal period.</li>
                            <li>The Tides are not a single historical event, but an ongoing catastrophe, as Lumen continues to sink further into the Depths.</li>

                            <li>Though a Mantra is described as a 'passage' that one 'speaks', the words cannot be pronounced, at least not by a human, and are not strictly even sounds.

                            <li>Speech isn't necessary to cast Mantras. The precise means of invoking a Mantra varies from person to person, but is broadly described as 'speaking' from within, akin to holding an inner monologue, or to bringing a memory to the forefront of your thoughts.</li>
                            <li>Often, the more one understands and is able to conjure forth the words of a Mantra, the more effective they are at using it.</li>

                            <li>Before its discovery, few within Lumen could perceive its tones. Now, it is inescapable. The Song is everywhere, like an earworm that lingers at the back of your mind, always ready to spring into action and play its tones once more.</li>
                            <li>The Song is not strictly music — it's not composed of sounds, or even words that can be pronounced by humans. However, much of the terminology surrounding the Song is musical in nature due to its striking similarities.</li>
                            <li>Many believe that the Song was responsible for the advent of the Tides, and of the resulting collapse of civilisation [sic].
